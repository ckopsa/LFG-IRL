# LFG-IRL
LFG-IRL [Looking For Group - In Real Life] is an application that helps organize group based events (sports, Pokemon Go, board games, card games, LAN parties, etc).

Persona/Scenario:

Colton is 23-year-old college student looking to have some fun. What he’d really like to do is go play some soccer, unfortunately you can’t play soccer by yourself, and although he might be able to get a few friends together, it won’t be enough for a fun game. So, he grabs his phone and opens up LFG-IRL. He scrolls to see if there are any upcoming games he could join in on, but they are all filled up already. So, he creates his own event. He plugs in “Soccer” and adds his friends he knows would want to play into the invite list, and pushed it out. A few of his friends accept the invite, and the rest of the spots fill in with other fellow soccer players. The PUG is planned up and now all they have to do is enjoy playing the game.

Matt is board game enthusiast trying to add more people to his group of other fellow board game friends. He often can only get one of his current friends to play with him, and sometimes not even that. He knows there are more people in his area that play board games, but he doesn't know how to reach out to them, and doesn't feel like doing the footwork to track them down the hard way.

A local youth group puts on weekly activities to help provide wholesome entertainment to fellow young people. They have good activities that really engage the participants and everyone leaves glad they came. The youth group knows that if they were able to reach out to a broader audience that they could have an even greater positive influence on the community.
